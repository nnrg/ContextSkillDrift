	abstract = {Sensor drift remains to be the most challenging problem in chemical sensing. To address this problem we have collected an extensive dataset for six different volatile organic compounds over a period of three years under tightly controlled operating conditions using an array of 16 metal-oxide gas sensors. The recordings were made using the same sensor array and a robust gas delivery system. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the most comprehensive datasets available for the design and development of drift compensation methods, which is freely reachable on-line. We introduced a machine learning approach, namely an ensemble of classifiers, to solve a gas discrimination problem over extended periods of time with high accuracy rates. Experiments clearly indicate the presence of drift in the sensors during the period of three years and that it degrades the performance of the classifiers. Our proposed ensemble method based on support vector machines uses a weighted combination of classifiers trained at different points of time. As our experimental results illustrate, the ensemble of classifiers is able to cope well with sensor drift and performs better than the baseline competing methods.},

	abstract = {Much of the computational power of the mammalian brain arises from its extensive top-down projections. To enable neuron-specific information processing these projections have to be precisely targeted. How such a specific connectivity emerges and what functions it supports is still poorly understood. We addressed these questions in silico in the context of the profound structural plasticity of the olfactory system. At the core of this plasticity are the granule cells of the olfactory bulb, which integrate bottom-up sensory inputs and top-down inputs delivered by vast top-down projections from cortical and other brain areas. We developed a biophysically supported computational model for the rewiring of the top-down projections and the intra-bulbar network via adult neurogenesis. The model captures various previous physiological and behavioral observations and makes specific predictions for the cortico-bulbar network connectivity that is learned by odor exposure and environmental contexts. Specifically, it predicts that—after learning—the granule-cell receptive fields with respect to sensory and with respect to cortical inputs are highly correlated. This enables cortical cells that respond to a learned odor to enact disynaptic inhibitory control specifically of bulbar principal cells that respond to that odor. For this the reciprocal nature of the granule cell synapses with the principal cells is essential. Functionally, the model predicts context-enhanced stimulus discrimination in cluttered environments (‘olfactory cocktail parties’) and the ability of the system to adapt to its tasks by rapidly switching between different odor-processing modes. These predictions are experimentally testable. At the same time they provide guidance for future experiments aimed at unraveling the cortico-bulbar connectivity.},

	abstract = {Smelling monomolecular odors hardly ever occurs in everyday life, and the daily functioning of the sense of smell relies primarily on the processing of complex mixtures of volatiles that are present in the environment (e.g., emanating from food or conspecifics). Such processing allows for the instantaneous recognition and categorization of smells and also for the discrimination of odors among others to extract relevant information and to adapt efficiently in different contexts. The neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning this highly efficient analysis of complex mixtures of odorants is beginning to be unraveled and support the idea that olfaction, as vision and audition, relies on odor-objects encoding. This configural processing of odor mixtures, which is empirically subject to important applications in our societies (e.g., the art of perfumers, flavorists, and wine makers), has been scientifically studied only during the last decades. This processing depends on many individual factors, among which are the developmental stage, lifestyle, physiological and mood state, and cognitive skills; this processing also presents striking similarities between species. The present review gathers the recent findings, as observed in animals, healthy subjects, and/or individuals with affective disorders, supporting the perception of complex odor stimuli as odor objects. It also discusses peripheral to central processing, and cognitive and behavioral significance. Finally, this review highlights that the study of odor mixtures is an original window allowing for the investigation of daily olfaction and emphasizes the need for knowledge about the underlying biological processes, which appear to be crucial for our representation and adaptation to the chemical environment.},

	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

	abstract = {The mammalian olfactory system learns new odors rapidly, exhibits negligible interference among odor memories, and identifies known odors under challenging conditions. The mechanisms by which it does so are unknown. We here present a general theory for odor learning and identification under noise in the olfactory system, and demonstrate its efficacy using a neuromorphic model of the olfactory bulb. As with biological olfaction, the spike timing-based algorithm utilizes distributed, event-driven computations and rapid online learning. Localized spike timing-dependent plasticity rules are employed iteratively over sequential gamma-frequency packets to construct odor representations from the activity of chemosensor arrays mounted in a wind tunnel. Learned odors then are reliably identified despite strong destructive interference. Noise resistance is enhanced by neuromodulation and contextual priming. Lifelong learning capabilities are enabled by adult neurogenesis. The algorithm is applicable to any signal identification problem in which high-dimensional signals are embedded in unknown backgrounds.},

	abstract = {Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are a standard tool for establishing relationships between data in many real world problems, in the absence of a parametric model. In the last decade, they have often been used for analyzing data produced by arrays of chemical sensors [electronic noses (e-noses)]. Still, the central issue of controlling the complexity of an MLP for optimal generalization is frequently overlooked by chemical sensors practitioners causing incorrect or suboptimal results (over or underfitting). In this paper, we will: 1) present different ways of controlling the complexity of an MLP (model order selection, early stopping, and regularization); 2) shortly review the literature on complexity control, inside and outside the e-nose community; and 3) give examples of effective complexity control for two e-noses datasets of different size and learning difficulty. It will be shown that, if early stopping or regularization are adopted, overfitting is avoided whatever the number of hidden units (and, hence, network weights). Another issue tackled in this paper is the influence on the generalization error of the number of principal components over which data are projected (before being fed into the MLP). Simulations show that (test set) performance depends strongly on the number of principal components and that even components with less than 1\% of the global variance enhance classification.},

Supervised learning focuses on the exploitation of a set of recorded data samples and a reference knowledge source in a process that is termed learning by examples.

In Section 7 a smart solution is provided for a difficult vapour recognition problem vexed by drift that have failed with traditional pattern recognition techniques. Among the many advantages we distinguish that model adaptation to changes in the sensor array makes lifelong calibration possible without interrupting the operation of the array.},

	abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are generally considered as the most promising pattern recognition method to process the signals from a chemical sensor array of electronic noses, which makes the system more bionics. This paper presents a chaotic neural network entitled KIII, which modeled olfactory systems, applied to an electronic nose to discriminate six typical volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Chinese rice wines. Thirty-two-dimensional feature vectors of a sensor array consisting of eight sensors, in which four features were extracted from the transient response of each TGS sensor, were input into the KIII network to investigate its generalization capability for concentration influence elimination and sensor drift counteraction. In comparison with the conventional back propagation trained neural network (BP-NN), experimental results show that the KIII network has a good performance in classification of these VOCs of different concentrations and even for the data obtained 1 month later than the training set. Its robust generalization capability is suitable for electronic nose applications to reduce the influence of concentration and sensor drift.},

	abstract = {Basic principles derived from biological olfaction, such as combining semiselective sensor arrays with pattern recognition, have been used to develop instrumentation capable of broad-band chemical detection and quantification. Commercially available instruments are useful in areas including quality control in the food, beverage and fragrance industries, environmental monitoring, chemical-purity and -mixture analysis, and medical diagnostics. Ongoing research is aimed at the development of more-advanced instruments that are smaller, cheaper, faster and more stable and reliable. These second-generation instruments are likely to find an increasing number of applications, including the on-line monitoring of fermentation and other bioprocesses.},

The used assessment criteria are subordinated to the proposed R\&D approach, which focuses on the study, and subsequent modelling, of sensors’ performance in realistic operation conditions by means of a combination of phenomenological and spectroscopic techniques. With this viewpoint, the paper presents both the to-date achievements and shortcomings of different experimental techniques, describes – by using selected examples – how the proposed approach can be used and proposes a set of objectives for the near future.},

	abstract = {The projections and odor responses of mammalian olfactory receptor neurons, as well as the physiology of the bulb's principal neurons—the mitral cells (MCs)—are known from studies in slices and anesthetized animals. In behaving rats trained to discriminate between two odors associated with different reinforcers, we examined MC responses following alternated odor–reinforcer pairings. Whereas only 11\% of the recorded MCs showed changes in odor-selective firing rate during the odor-sampling phase, 94\% of MCs modulated activity during specific behaviors surrounding odor sampling. These cell- and odor-selective responses were not primary sensory responses; rather, they depended (reversibly) on the predictive value of each odor. MC activity thus depends critically on efferent influences linked to the animal's experience and behavior.},
