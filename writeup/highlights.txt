1. Recurrent neural networks learned to represent contextual information extracted from sequences of sensor array recordings.

2. Compared to neural networks without context, neural networks with context more accurately classified samples affected by sensor drift from an unseen time window.

3. The neural networks with context generalized better to unseen sensor drift settings than did ensembles of support vector machines (SVMs).
